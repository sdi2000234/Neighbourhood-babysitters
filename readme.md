Full frontend interface for every possible user choice, according to the assignment instructions (including additional wireframes for notifications and messages). Complete implementation of the wireframes from the 2nd assignment (with corrections based on previous feedback). The following functions are working through the database: registration, login, profile creation, profile editing, ad creation, appointment management (bidirectional connection between Parent–Professional), application management (bidirectional connection between Parent–Professional).

Although frames have been created for payment, history, and agreements, the real-time communication with the database for retrieving data has not yet been implemented.
